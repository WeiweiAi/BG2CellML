model-component annotations include those that are about (a) physical
properties (such as those that might be encoded by CellML variables), (b) physical entities (such as
“species” in SBML), and (c) processes, such as biochemical reactions.

For annotations on model components, composite annotations
have two primary elements: the physical property represented by the annotated item (e.g., chemical
concentration, fluid volume) and the physical entity, process, energy differential, or dependency that bears the property (e.g., a pool of ATP in the cytoplasm, blood in a cardiac cavity, the glucokinase
reaction).

For the physical property portions, we recommend using terms from
the Ontology of Physics for Biology (OPB [14]) because the OPB provides a comprehensive, formally structured hierarchy of physical properties.

It is critical to
note that reactions are processes, whereas reaction flow rates are properties of those processes. Thus,
regardless of modeling language, our annotations include the process, its participants, and its properties.
